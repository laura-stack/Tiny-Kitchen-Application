Purpose
------------
Tiny Kitchen helps everyone choose and plan meals with ease. 
Our application offers users a large selection of recipes to 
choose from based on given guidelines, such as dietary 
restrictions and current pantry stock. Users can easily plan 
meals using a calendar and file system in order to save 
time and money.  

Scenarios
------------

	1. Scenario: User will create their own recipe cards.
	Description: 

	2. Scenario: User will manage their recipe cards.
	Description: Users may interact with the Tiny Kitchen application
	by managing recipe cards. This includes editing recipe details and 
	deleting recipe cards altogether. Management also includes the ability
	to add recipe cards to collections, the pantry, and the calendar. 
	Being able to manage the recipe card in a number of ways is key to 
	Tiny Kitchen, as the recipes are the central feature of Tiny Kitchen. 

	3. Scenario: User will share recipe cards and shopping list.
	Description: Users may interact with the Tiny Kitchen application by 
	sharing recipe cards and/or shopping lists they have created using
	Tiny Kitchen. This share feature allows users to select certain
	recipes to be attached to an email and shared with others. It also
	allows for the shopping list, which is created from the user's calendar
	view, to be shared via email. This share feature is key to Tiny Kitchen, 
	as shareability and ease of use is essential to the program. The ability
	to share your local recipes and shopping lists with anyone allows for improved
	quality and usefulness of Tiny Kitchen overall.
