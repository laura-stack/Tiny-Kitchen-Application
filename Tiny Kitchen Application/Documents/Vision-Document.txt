1: Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o 1.1 Purpose
------------------------------
▪ The purpose of this vision document is to identify, analyze, and define all 
requirements and features of the Tiny Kitchen Application, as well as all 
restrictions it may entail. It focuses on the capabilities needed by the 
stakeholders and the target users, and why these needs exist. The details 
of how Tiny Kitchen Application fulfills these needs are detailed in the 
summary of capabilities. The details of constraints, assumptions, dependencies, 
and other product requirements are outlined in this document in order to provide 
a clear overview of the Tiny Kitchen’s limitations in advance.  

o 1.2 Scope 
------------------------------
▪ This Vision Document is constructed for the Tiny Kitchen Application,
which will be developed by Autumn Hale, Laura Lopez, and Victoria Senn. 
These stakeholders will develop the WPF application to work on the latest 
version of Windows computers. The Tiny Kitchen will allow anyone with 
dietary restrictions, little time, and/or meal coordination needs to 
easily choose and plan their meals. This vision document represents an 
ideal set of features and depends on time and further design decisions 
which may change the project.  

2: Positioning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o 2.1 Business opportunity
------------------------------
▪ Many people struggle with balancing work, school, and other obligations.
It can be difficult for households to decide what to cook, especially with 
picky eaters, limited budget, or dietary restrictions. Tiny Kitchen helps 
everyone choose and plan meals with ease. Our application offers users a 
large selection of recipes to choose from based on their guidelines, 
such as dietary restrictions and current pantry stock. Users can easily 
plan meals using a calendar and file system in order to save time and money.  

o 2.2 Problem statement
------------------------------
▪ The problem of meal preparation and planning affects college students, families, 
those with dietary restrictions, and many others. The impact of the problem is 
uncoordinated schedules, bad eating habits, and stress-filled individuals. A 
successful solution would include a meal planning application that provides 
recipes based on search criteria and the ability to create virtual recipe cards.
